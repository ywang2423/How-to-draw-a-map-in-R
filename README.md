# How-to-draw-a-map-in-R

Actually this is just a summary of many methods I found on the Internet while working for Center for Policy Simulation (CPS), China Institute of Income Distribution. All the references were listed in the PDF file.
This essay was initially published on the wechat subscribe account of CPS.
